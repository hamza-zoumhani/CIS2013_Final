# CIS2013_Final

-Favorite part about the class:
1.Your experience shows whenever you explain new stuff.
2.You are comfortable in class and make us feel comfortable (putting aside all the failling jokes).
3.You push us to do more (it works, to a degree).

-Least favorite part about the class:
1.AC is too damn cold.
2.I can't see a lot with projector with lights on.
3.Class cancelled 30min before class (I was annoyed that I didn't learn a new thing from you that day).

-What could be done better in the class:
1.Turn down the damn AC.
2.Turn the lights off when projector is on (but I guess you like to see our faces when you explain :/).
3.Would be nice if students are be encouraged to push on gitHub for some extra credit.
